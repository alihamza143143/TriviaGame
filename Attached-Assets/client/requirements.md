## Packages
framer-motion | Complex animations for board movement and modals
canvas-confetti | Celebration effect for winning
@types/canvas-confetti | Types for confetti
lucide-react | Icons for UI elements (already in base, but confirming usage)

## Notes
The game logic has been ported from vanilla JS to React state.
High scores are fetched from the backend API.
Audio effects would be a nice addition but sticking to visual polish for now.
